# API Integration

The current system architecture is designed with command-line interfaces (CLI) interacting directly with libraries. However, the long-term goal is to introduce a **RESTful API layer** that will consume the business logic from these libraries, making the system more **scalable, modular, and adaptable** for future integrations.

## Key API Considerations

The API integration strategy is based on several core principles that ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Separation of Concerns** - The API will act as an intermediary between CLI tools and libraries, ensuring a clean and modular architecture.
- **Standardized Access** - The API will provide a structured, well-documented interface to interact with the system in a uniform way.
- **Future CLI Evolution** - CLI tools will transition to consuming the API instead of interacting with libraries directly, making the system more scalable.
- **Ensuring a Fully API-Ready System** - CLI tools should not embed business logic directly but instead delegate all operations to reusable libraries or APIs.
- **No Business Logic in API** - The API itself will not contain business logic but will act as a processing layer that exposes the logic implemented in libraries.
- **Cost Considerations** - API implementation has been deferred to minimize hosting costs until the core system is fully developed.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of these principles and their implications.

## Separation of Concerns
Instead of having CLI tools interact directly with libraries, the API will act as an intermediary. This abstraction ensures a cleaner architecture, reducing tight coupling between different system components.

## Standardized Access
The API will expose a structured and well-documented interface, ensuring a **uniform and predictable** way to interact with the system. This will improve integration capabilities for future tools and external applications.

## Future CLI Evolution
Once the API is fully implemented, CLI tools will transition from consuming libraries directly to consuming the API. This will enhance scalability, as API-based interactions are more flexible and allow for distributed and remote execution of commands.

## Ensuring a Fully API-Ready System
To guarantee API readiness, all CLI tools must strictly separate concerns and avoid embedding any business logic directly. Instead, they should only handle:
- **Interface processing** (handling user input, parsing commands, and displaying output).
- **Delegating all business logic** to reusable libraries or APIs.

This ensures that when the transition happens, the system will be fully prepared to switch from CLI-library interactions to an API-driven model **without major refactoring**.

## No Business Logic in API
The API itself does not contain business logic; instead, it processes and utilizes the libraries to expose the logic implemented within them. This approach ensures that the API remains a lightweight interface layer rather than an execution layer.

## Cost Considerations
API implementation has been **deferred to minimize hosting costs** until the core system is fully developed. This approach allows resources to be allocated efficiently while keeping the system adaptable for future API-based expansion.

## Future-Proofing the System
By structuring the system with API readiness in mind, we ensure that the transition to an API-based architecture will be smooth and efficient. This planned evolution supports:
- **Improved modularity** by decoupling interfaces from business logic.
- **Better scalability** through a standardized API for all system interactions.
- **Greater flexibility** in integrating additional tools or third-party services.

This approach ensures that the system remains adaptable and ready for seamless migration to an API-based model when the time is right.
