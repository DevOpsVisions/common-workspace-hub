# Database Overview

The database is designed with a comprehensive structure to ensure efficiency, scalability, and historical tracking of changes. It follows best practices for data integrity, structured queries, and controlled modifications. This document provides an overview of key architectural components, followed by a detailed breakdown of each aspect of the database structure.

## Key Components of the Database Structure:

1. **Structured Tables** - A well-organized schema that optimizes queries and maintains data integrity.
2. **Historical Logging** - Change tracking is implemented using history tables, preserving pre- and post-change values.
3. **Stored Procedures** - All database inputs rely on stored procedures to ensure consistency and controlled modifications.
4. **Views for Continuous Access** - Frequently accessed data is exposed through predefined views to enhance query performance.
5. **Version Control and Database Configuration Management** - The database schema is maintained in version control, with plans to implement automated deployment tools like Liquibase.

Each of these components ensures that the database remains reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain. The following sections provide a detailed explanation of each aspect.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Structured Tables

The foundation of the database is built upon a well-organized schema that ensures data is structured efficiently. Tables are designed to optimize query performance and maintain data integrity.

#### Key Features:
- **Optimized Query Performance** - The schema is designed to reduce redundancy and improve lookup speeds.
- **Data Integrity Enforcement** - Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints ensure that relationships between entities are maintained correctly.
- **Scalability Considerations** - Tables are structured to support a growing dataset while ensuring efficient query execution.

### Historical Logging

To maintain a complete record of data modifications, history tables are implemented. These tables store previous versions of records, allowing full change tracking.

#### Change Tracking Mechanism:
- **Auditability** - Any change to critical tables is logged to ensure accountability.
- **Pre- and Post-Change Values** - Modifications store both the previous and updated values.
- **Example:** If a member updates their phone number:
  - The previous number is recorded in the history table.
  - The updated number is stored in the primary members table.

### Stored Procedures

All database modifications rely on stored procedures to maintain consistency and enforce validation rules.

#### Benefits of Stored Procedures:
- **Data Consistency** - Ensures that all modifications adhere to predefined rules.
- **Security** - Reduces risks by centralizing execution logic within the database.
- **Controlled Data Modifications** - Limits direct table modifications, ensuring that only validated data is inserted or updated.

### Views for Continuous Access

To improve efficiency, frequently accessed data is made available through predefined views. These views serve as a structured way to expose data without requiring complex queries each time.

#### Advantages of Using Views:
- **Optimized Query Performance** - Reduces the need for repetitive joins and aggregations.
- **Real-Time Data Access** - Ensures that relevant information is always available without additional computation.
- **Simplified Data Retrieval** - Abstracts the underlying schema, making data retrieval easier for applications and analysts.

### Version Control and Database Configuration Management

To maintain consistency and track database changes over time, version control is implemented. Future improvements include the integration of automated deployment tools.

#### Key Practices in Version Control:
- **SQL Scripts in Version Control** - The current approach involves exporting the database schema as SQL scripts and storing them in version control. However, this is not considered a best practice as it lacks automation and structured change management.
- **Change Management** - Schema modifications are documented, ensuring controlled updates.
- **Future Integration with Liquibase** - To improve version control and change management, plans are in place to implement Liquibase, which will:
  - Automate database deployments.
  - Maintain versioning consistency.
  - Enable rollback capabilities for controlled updates.

## Conclusion

By implementing structured tables, historical logging, stored procedures, optimized views, and version control, the database is designed to support efficient and scalable operations. The planned adoption of database configuration management tools further strengthens the databaseâ€™s ability to handle controlled and automated updates, ensuring long-term reliability and maintainability.
