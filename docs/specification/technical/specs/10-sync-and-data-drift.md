# Sync and Data Drift Monitoring

As the database serves as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**, it is essential to maintain data consistency across all integrated platforms. A comprehensive review report must be generated from the database to provide a snapshot of the current state of members, mentors, courses, groups, and advisors. This report acts as a **status check**, ensuring that the latest data is correctly reflected across all systems.

Ensuring **data consistency** across different platforms is critical. The system must continuously **monitor, report, and audit** data synchronization issues and drift, ensuring that every platform reflects the correct state as recorded in the database.

Additionally, the system must provide an option to **manage synchronization**, allowing decisions on whether to:
- Add missing users to the correct platform.
- Remove users who are incorrectly present.
- Update roles and permissions to match the database.

For example, if members are registered for a sales course in the database but are missing from the corresponding Microsoft Teams channel, the system should detect the issue and suggest corrective actions. Similarly, if users appear in a course but are not reflected in WordPress LMS, the system must highlight the inconsistency.

## Key Elements of Sync and Data Drift Monitoring

To maintain accurate synchronization and prevent data drift, the system focuses on several key elements:

- **Data Sync and Integrity Checks** - Regular audits ensure that data across all platforms matches the database.
- **Data Drift Measurement and Reporting** - The system monitors and reports inconsistencies across platforms.
- **Audit Logs and Tracking** - Every sync operation is logged for historical tracking, compliance, and troubleshooting.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of each key element.

## Data Sync and Integrity Checks

To maintain accurate synchronization, the system performs regular **sync audits** and generates validation reports to compare platform data against the database.

### Key Aspects:
- **Regular Sync Audits** - The system runs scheduled audits to verify that data across WordPress, Microsoft Teams, Question-to-Answer, and Azure matches the database.
- **Validation Reports** - Reports highlight discrepancies such as:
  - Members registered in the database for a specific course but missing from the corresponding Microsoft Teams channel.
  - Users assigned to a course but not appearing in the WordPress LMS.
  - Members who passed the Compliance Quiz but still have restricted access.
  - Guest accounts that should be disabled but remain active in Azure.
- **Sync Automation** - When a discrepancy is detected, the system can:
  - Automatically trigger corrections.
  - Notify the operations team for manual intervention.

## Data Drift Measurement and Reporting

The system tracks **data drift** across platforms to identify and mitigate inconsistencies.

### Key Aspects:
- **Drift Detection Metrics**:
  - Number of users inconsistently registered across platforms.
  - Users with incorrect permissions or missing roles.
  - Delayed updates where changes in the database are not yet reflected in platforms.
- **Comprehensive Reports**:
  - Daily, weekly, and monthly sync reports generated for review.
  - Reports highlight system-wide drift and provide recommended corrective actions.
- **Operational Alerts**:
  - The system sends real-time alerts when data inconsistencies exceed a predefined threshold.
  - Alerts help the operations team take immediate corrective actions.

## Audit Logs and Tracking

All sync operations are logged for **historical tracking** and compliance purposes.

### Key Aspects:
- **Historical Tracking**:
  - Every sync operation is logged to track changes over time.
  - The history of discrepancies and corrections is stored for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Audit Tools**:
  - Administrators can run manual audits on demand to verify system consistency.
  - The system provides detailed logs for troubleshooting sync failures.

## Conclusion

By integrating **sync audits, drift monitoring, and automated correction mechanisms**, the system ensures that all platforms remain **aligned with the database**, preventing inconsistencies that could impact the member experience.

This approach guarantees that the database remains the **SSOT**, with all other platforms accurately reflecting its data in real time, minimizing errors and ensuring smooth operations.
