# Help and Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is a critical part of the system. Every **public method, CLI command, and future API endpoint** must be well-documented to ensure clarity, usability, and ease of maintenance.

## Key Elements of Help and Documentation

To ensure accessible and well-structured documentation, the system follows these key elements:

- **Library, CLI, and API Documentation** - Detailed documentation for all CLI commands and API endpoints, including descriptions, parameters, and usage examples.
- **Auto-Generated Documentation** - Automated generation of documentation from inline code comments to maintain consistency.
- **Accessibility and Distribution** - Documentation must be easily accessible to developers, end-users, and operations teams.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of each element.

## Library, CLI, and API Documentation

All public methods for **libraries, CLI commands, and future API endpoints** must be documented with **detailed descriptions, parameters, usage examples, expected results, and interactions with other system components.**

### Key Aspects:
- **Comprehensive Library Documentation**:
  - Every library must include inline documentation for all public methods and functions.
  - Documentation should cover method purpose, input parameters, return values, and examples of usage.
  - Libraries should include structured guides on how they interact with CLI tools and APIs.
- **Comprehensive CLI Documentation**:
  - Every CLI tool must provide an accessible `--help` command that displays structured documentation directly in the terminal.
  - Detailed documentation for each command must be available in a structured format.
- **Standardized API Documentation**:
  - API endpoints must follow the same documentation standard to ensure consistency across interfaces.
  - Documentation must include request/response examples and authentication details.
- **Docs as Code Approach**:
  - Documentation is maintained within the codebase and published using platforms such as:
    - GitHub Docs
    - Azure DevOps Docs
    - A dedicated documentation website

## Auto-Generated Documentation for Libraries, CLI, and APIs

To ensure that documentation remains up to date with system changes, all **libraries, CLI methods, public functions, and APIs** must include inline documentation.

### Key Aspects:
- **Inline Documentation**:
  - XML or Markdown documentation must be embedded within the code.
- **Automated Documentation Generation**:
  - Tools like **Swagger** (for APIs) and **Doxygen or DocFX** (for CLI and libraries) must be used to generate documentation automatically.
- **Continuous Updates**:
  - Documentation should be updated automatically whenever a change occurs in the system, avoiding manual updates.

## Accessibility and Distribution

The documentation must be structured in a way that ensures easy access for all stakeholders.

### Key Aspects:
- **Developer Access**:
  - Available through code comments and generated API documentation.
- **End-User Accessibility**:
  - CLI tools must include the `--help` command for quick reference.
- **Operations Team Usage**:
  - A structured documentation portal must be maintained for operational reference.
- **Versioned Documentation**:
  - The system should support multiple versions of documentation to allow users to access information relevant to their current software version.

## Initial Documentation Portal

The initial help portal should follow the **Moonwalk GitHub theme or a similar or better structured documentation framework** for presentation:
- **Reference:** [Moonwalk GitHub Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/moonwalk/)
- This theme provides a structured and accessible documentation site for users and developers.

## Conclusion

By enforcing a **comprehensive documentation approach**, the **Elmentor Program** ensures that all functionalities are **well-documented, easy to use, and adaptable to future developments**.

### Summary of Documentation Benefits:
- **Clear and structured documentation** for CLI, libraries, and APIs.
- **Automated updates** using documentation generation tools.
- **Versioned and accessible documentation** for different system versions.
- **A dedicated documentation portal** for ease of use and reference.

This structured approach guarantees **maintainability, clarity, and usability** for all system components.
