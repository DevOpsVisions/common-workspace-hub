# Testing Strategy

A robust integration and end-to-end testing framework is implemented to ensure system stability and correctness. Each function within the system must have associated tests to verify that it operates as expected, ensuring all processes complete successfully and meet predefined criteria.

## Key Testing Areas

- **End-to-End Testing** - Verifies that all functional operations execute successfully across all platforms.
- **Integration Testing** - Ensures smooth interactions between different components, such as CLI tools, business logic libraries, and databases.
- **Pre and Post-Condition Validation** - Confirms the system's state before and after execution to ensure correct data handling.
- **Automated Reporting and Debugging** - Logs test execution results for tracking, debugging, and audit purposes.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of each testing area.

## End-to-End Testing

Every functional operation must be verified end-to-end to confirm that it executes successfully across all platforms. This ensures that dependent systems such as database updates, platform synchronization, and user notifications work together correctly.

### Key Aspects:
- **Full workflow validation** - Tests cover all major processes, ensuring they function across platforms.
- **Example:** If 10 members are registered in WordPress, the test must validate that all 10 users have been successfully registered by checking the actual user list and ensuring proper role assignments.
- **Cross-platform consistency** - Ensures database records, user assignments, and notifications align correctly.

## Integration Testing

Integration testing ensures smooth interaction between different system components, validating how CLI tools, business logic libraries, and databases interact.

### Key Aspects:
- **Component-level validation** - Ensures that different modules interact correctly without issues.
- **Example:** A test verifying the registration process should check:
  - Data is correctly retrieved from the input source (e.g., Excel file).
  - The user is successfully created in WordPress, Microsoft Teams, and the database.
  - An email confirmation is sent with login credentials.
  - The user is assigned the correct permissions.
- **Workflow protection** - Each integration point is validated to prevent issues from breaking the process.

## Pre and Post-Condition Validation

Every automated test must compare the systemâ€™s state before and after execution to ensure expected changes occur correctly.

### Key Aspects:
- **State verification** - Tests confirm that system updates reflect expected outcomes.
- **Example:** Before registering a new user, the test will confirm they do not already exist in WordPress. After execution, the test will verify that the user appears in the WordPress user list with the correct attributes.
- **Data integrity checks** - Ensures no unexpected changes occur during the process.

## Automated Reporting and Debugging

Every test execution generates a detailed report, logging all actions taken and confirming whether they were successful.

### Key Aspects:
- **Detailed test reports** - Every test run includes logs of executed actions, pass/fail status, and validation details.
- **Failure handling** - Tests must provide detailed error messages and logs for quick debugging.
- **Audit tracking** - Reports are stored for historical tracking and compliance.

## Conclusion

By enforcing end-to-end, integration, and validation testing, the **Elmentor Program** ensures that all functionalities are continuously verified and the system remains stable and reliable at all times.

### Summary of Testing Benefits:
- **Verification of all transactions** (e.g., user registration, data consistency, automation execution).
- **Pre and post-condition comparisons** to validate state changes.
- **Reporting and tracking** for debugging and auditability.

This structured testing approach ensures system reliability, maintains data integrity, and provides continuous validation of all key processes.
